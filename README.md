- ADSR envelope characteristics detection (attack/decay time)
- Finding drum samples which are similar to a given sample based on audio characteristics
- implementing a WaveGAN model in PyTorch to generate drum samples based on sample packs
- Synth parameter inference using Ableton's Wavetable (trying to predict which parameters were used on wavetable given an audio sample)
